Letter symbols for physical quantities
======================================

`lettsymb`: a LaTeX package to provide standardized commands for the symbols of
physical quantities.


Purpose
-------

The purpose is to allow LaTeX users to worry more about the content of their
documents and less about the implementation, especially when particular symbols
are complex to implement.


Categories
----------

The physical quantities are divided into the following primary categories:

- Space and time (kinematics)

- Mechanics

- Thermodynamics

- Electromagnetism

- Light and radiation

- Acoustics

- Chemistry

Additional commands are also given for dimensions and dimensionless numbers.
