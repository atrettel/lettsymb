Letter symbols for physical quantities
======================================

`lettsymb`: a LaTeX package to provide standardized commands for the symbols of
physical quantities.


Purpose
-------

It is easy to confuse different symbols in science and engineering.  Is the
letter P the pressure or power here?  Is the letter omega the angular velocity
or the vorticity here?  The purpose of `lettsymb` is to allow LaTeX users to
worry more about the content of their documents and less about the
implementation, especially when particular symbols are complex to implement.
This package provides a simple set of commands to create custom commands for
the symbols of quantities, along with a library of commands using standardized
symbols of quantities.

Usage
-----


### Loading the package

```latex
\usepackage{lettsymb}
```

Currently no package options are implemented, but some options are planned to
give users control over what symbols are used in the standard library.


### Creating symbol commands

To create a command, simply use one of the creation commands:

```latex
\newQuantity{\qNumberOfBananas}{b}
```

The first argument is the name of the commands to create, and the second
argument is the symbol to use.  Do not put any superscripts or subscripts in
the second argument, since they interfere with labels or exponents.

If the symbol you want to create contains a subscript or a label, use the
`\newLabeledQuantity` instead:

```latex
\newLabeledQuantity{\qNumberOfApples}{n}{\mathrm{apples}}
```

This command will correctly place the subscript so that it does not interfere
with any additional labels.  Additional labels are available via the optional
argument:

```latex
\qVolume[1]

\qVolume[\mathrm{cube}]

\qVolume[\mathrm{sphere}]
```

The commands `\newExtensiveQuantity`, `\newSpecificQuantity`, and
`\newMolarQuantity` are used to create extensive and intensive variables.  They
follow how `\newQuantity` works but also change the given symbol automatically
to adjust it to a standardized form, to better distinguish between extensive
and intensive quantities.


### Using symbol commands

To use any symbol command from the standard library, you first must know its
name.  All names in the standard library follow a simple pattern:

1. A letter denoting the type of the symbol.

    - `d` for symbol of a dimension.

    - `q` for the preferred symbol of a quantity.

    - `a` for the alternative symbol of a quantity.  Alternative symbols can be
      used when you need two symbols for a type of quantity or when another
      quantity uses the same symbol as the preferred symbol.

    - `v` for the vector symbol of a quantity.

2. The name of the concept in `CamelCase` (like `SpecificHeat` for "specific
heat").

Combine these two and you can easily know the command for any given symbol of a
dimension or quantity.

Examples:

- `\dTime` is the command for symbol of the dimension of time and `\qTime` is
  the command for symbol of the quantity of time.

- `\qLength` is the command for the preferred symbol for the quantity of length
  and `\aLength` is the command for the alternative symbol for the quantity of
  length.

Finally, you can use any command just as you would use any variable.

```latex
The speed of sound of an ideal gas is a function of the heat capacity ratio,
the specific gas constant, and the temperature:
%
\begin{equation}
    \qSpeedOfSound[\mathrm{ig}]^2
    =
    \qHeatCapacityRatio
    \qSpecificGasConstant
    \qTemperature
    \,.
\end{equation}
```

```latex
\begin{equation}
    \qDensity
    =
    \frac{
        \qMass
    }{
        \qVolume
    }
    \,.
\end{equation}
```
