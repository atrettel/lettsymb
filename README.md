Letter symbols for physical quantities
======================================

`lettsymb`: a LaTeX package to provide standardized commands for the symbols of
physical quantities.


Purpose
-------

It is easy to confuse different symbols in science and engineering.  Is the
letter P the pressure or power here?  Is the letter omega the angular velocity
or the vorticity here?  The purpose of `lettsymb` is to allow LaTeX users to
worry more about the content of their documents and less about the
implementation, especially when particular symbols are complex to implement.  A
major goal is to make it possible to change the symbols in a document by only
changing the package options.


Categories
----------

The physical quantities are divided into the following primary categories:

- Space and time (kinematics)

- Mechanics

- Thermodynamics

- Electromagnetism

- Light and radiation

- Chemistry

Additional commands are also given for dimensions and dimensionless numbers.
